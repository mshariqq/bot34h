## Bot34h is basically, a bot that will write an entire project by creating new files and new lines of code by reading an existing project.

So, it does this job "A human can take 1 or 2 weeks to replicate a project by reading an existing project files and code", so this bot can do the job in minutes.


Inspiration: to keep coding halaal and clean, instead of copying and using existing projects, we can create our new project with our file checksum and properties in our machine.


### To Run
Step 1: To run this bot, PHP must be installed, Create 2 folders in this project (SRC, NEW_CREATION if doesnt exist)
Step 2: The existing project should be pasted into the SRC folder
Step 3: Then run the command "php bot34h.php" in this project, the new project will be written in the NEW_CREATION folder.

This project also has an addon bot called bot65h, which can replicate SQL files.
Same as bot34h.
