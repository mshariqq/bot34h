## Bot34h is basically, a bot that will write an entire project by creating new files and new lines of code by reading an existing project.

So, it does this job "A human can take 1 or 2 weeks to replicate a project by reading an existing project files and code", so this bot can do the job in minutes.


Inspiration: to keep coding halaal and clean, instead of copying and using existing projects, we can create our new project with our file checksum and properties in our machine.



### To Run: To run this bot, PHP must be installed, the existing project should be pasted into the SRC folder, and then run the command "php bot34h.php", the new project will be written in the NEW_CREATION folder.

This project also has an addon bot called bot65h, which can replicate SQL files.
Same as bot34h.
